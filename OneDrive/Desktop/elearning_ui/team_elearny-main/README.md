# team-elearny (UI ~ version 0)

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

### IMPORTANT:

For projects with Firestore integration, you must first run the following commands to ensure the project compiles:

```
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This command creates the generated files that parse each Record from Firestore into a schema object.

### Getting started continued:

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
